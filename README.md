# Epic Calculator

This project was created in the video [How I made an EPIC CALCULATOR](https://youtu.be/5dxCDSKqwyc) (https://youtu.be/5dxCDSKqwyc). 

The file I was mainly editing in the video is the file in the /lib/main.dart file.

If you wish to run this project, you will need to install the math_expressions for dart. You can do this by running ``pub upgrade``. Github wouldn't allow me to upload my build folder so if you wanted to build this, it may take longer.

You can publish this app for free but please don't publish this app and charge money for it. I developed this project open source for educational purposes and I intent to let people use it, modify it and publish it (for free). 

Thanks,
IO;
